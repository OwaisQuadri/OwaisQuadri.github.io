                     Before Dubai was the giant industrialized city we see today, it was just like any 
                     other city. It was rich with traditions and culture. Also, Dubai was located in 
                     a very significant place that is important for trading for Iran. Because of the fact that 
                     Dubai did not want to abandon or forget these traditions and their past, the 
                     construction in dubai has completely preserved some sites that show the richness of their culture.
                     this part of Dubai is called "Old Dubai". There is a distinct difference and you can tell
                     whether you are looking at Old or New Dubai based on the height of the buildings as shown (right).

                      The growth of Dubai as a city is phenomenal.
                      This is why Dubai is the 6th most visited place on the planet. The reason that dubai grew from
                      a trading port, to a city of skyscrapers is because they found oil. The oil era for dubai was 
                      a time of great growth and the revenue that was gained from the oil industry eventually 
                      lead to them making significant advances in their real estate (skyscrapers and huge malls).
