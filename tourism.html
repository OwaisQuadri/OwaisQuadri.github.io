                          There are many reasons that Dubai is one of the most visited cities in the 
                          world. There are 3 types of tourist attractions; Hotels/Malls, Monuments/Parks and Museums. Dubai has all of these:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Burj Khalifa Hotel : The tallest building on earth.</li>
                                <li>Burj Al-Arab: The third tallest pure hotel on earth.</li>
                                <li>Atlantis, the Palm: Hotel</li>

                        <p>
                            The top two reasons to come to dubai are the record breaking buildings:

                           The Burj Khalifa (shown above) was originally named, Burj Dubai , meaning "Dubai Tower". It was renamed
                           as a tribute to Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan,
                           head of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi. The construction 
                           of the building took from 2004 to 2009 (5 years). and it is still standing
                           above all else as the tallest building on planet earth. This is the main
                           reason that people visit this city. if you dont go anywhere else in Dubai,
                           you must go to the Burj Khalifa and bask in all its glory.

                            The Dubai frame is known as the tallest (150m) standing frame in the world. 
                            It is also a museum about the history of the city of Dubai. The museum/artifact is
                            also enclosed in a park so there is more for a tourist to explore. once you reach the top of the 
                            museum, on one side, through the window is a beautiful view of New Dubai. The other side is a stunning view of Old Dubai. 
                            on the way up, there is a museum of Old Dubai. On the way down is a museum of New Dubai. This becomes a well rounded learning experience about history and culture.
